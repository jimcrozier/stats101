# Introduction {#intro}

This textbok accompanies an introductory statistical analysis course run by the Data Science team. It will take place over the 5 Tuesdays in March 2020 (though March 24th will be a review / catch-up day... go vote!). The purpose of this course is to help develop a solid foundation of basic statistical intuition. We aren't going to dive too deeply into the math, but we aren't going to shy away understanding the formulas. You will get the most out of the lectures if you are comfortable with basic algebra. The course is open to anyone with manager approval. For this first iteration we will limit enrollment to 15 and the course will be remote friendly. The course is two hours per week, and the format will be a one hour lecture followed by a one hour interactive computer lab.

The confluence page for the course is located at  [go.rsglab.com/stats101](go.rsglab.com/stats101).
